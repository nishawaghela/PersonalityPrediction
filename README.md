# PersonalityPrediction
 Social networking platforms nowadays generate a huge amount of data every second, emerging dramatically within the last 10 years. This vast rich data provides crucial information about social interactions and human behaviour. Therefore, it is possible to identify personality traits of a person by extracting and analyzing relevant information from their social media. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is one of the most widely-used personality tests. It classifies people into 16 4-letter categories. The dataset to be used contains a person’s Myers-Briggs type and the text of their online posts.  So, here we can use Machine Learning algorithm XGBoost which is a decision tree-based technique that uses the gradient boosting framework to predict someone’s personality type based on what they write online.
